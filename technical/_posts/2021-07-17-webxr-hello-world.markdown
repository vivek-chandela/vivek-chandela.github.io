Let me directly show you how to make your first VR project using Aframe. And then we can look through the technical details.

Head over to Glitch and create an account. Next go to New Project -> hello-webpage. This creates your very first project on Glitch. 

You can see some files on the left side of your project. Let me briefly explain what they do:
index.html - This is where most of the development takes place. The code you write is what gets rendered on your web page/smartphone.
style.css - A simple CSS file to add styling to your content.
script.js - To add interactivity and make your content dynamic by adding  some Javascript.
assets - This is a folder where you can add all your images, audios, videos, 3D objects and many more which you want to display in your AR/VR scenarios. Glitch creates a CDN for these assets and improves the speed of delivery.
