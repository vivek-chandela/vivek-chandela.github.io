When we invest in mutual funds with identical holdings or portfolio allocation, we do not gain any additional value on our investments. Also, similar holdings eat up the power of diversification in our portfolio. This phenomenon is known as **Mutual Fund Overlap**.

So, it might appear that we are diversifying our portfolio by investing in multiple mutual funds, but it is quite the opposite. Moreover, in case of any downturns, it affects more on the overall value of the portfolio.

E.g., Axis Bluechip Fund and Canara Robeco Bluechip Fund have a big overlap

Mutual Funds overlap depends on:

- **Holdings overlap:** If you find that most of the stocks are common in both the funds, then we have holdings overlap.

- **Sectoral overlap:** It is better if both the schemes have investments in different sectors.

- **Categorial overlap:** Try to avoid investing in more than one large-cap plan, one mid-cap, small-cap, bond fund, etc.

There are some free tools for checking MF Overlap:

1. [The Fundoo](https://www.thefundoo.com/Tools/PortfolioOverlap)

2. [Advisor Khoj](https://www.advisorkhoj.com/mutual-funds-research/mutual-fund-portfolio-overlap)

**My Rule of thumb:** Number of common socks <= 10 and overall overlap percentage <= 15%
