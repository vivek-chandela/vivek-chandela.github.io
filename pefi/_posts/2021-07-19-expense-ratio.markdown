Expense ratio is the annual fee charged by the mutual fund to the investors for management purposes (administrative cost, marketing cost, promotion cost, distribution cost, compliance costs, shareholder service cost, etc.).

Mutual funds don't directly manage the funds; they use AMC (Asset Management Companies), which incurs the expenses.

>Expense ratio = Expenses / AUM <br>
where, AUM = Asset under management = Total size of MF fund (in crores)

The expense ratio comes in handy in the following ways:

- As the size of the fund increases, the expense ratio decreases.

- The expense ratio of a direct plan (no broker involved using apps like Zerodha, INDMoney, Kuvera) is lower than a regular plan (you invest using a broker). So, ALWAYS use direct plan investing.

- Lower the expense ratio of a mutual fund, better are your returns.

E.g.,

</p>

In the above case, an expense ratio of 1% decreases our returns by approx three lakh rupees !!

**My Rule of thumb:** Choose a fund with an expense ratio in the range of 0.5-0.7% or lower.

**Note:** Expense ratio is just one parameter among a host of other metrics to decide good mutual funds for your portfolio.
